# Map App

A flutter project that uses the BLoC architecture for state management and leverages several location and weather APIs to display information about points of interests. The map was built using MapBox's maps service and the locations are generated randomly around Canberra, ACT, Australia.

Users can get directions, ratings, and randomised descriptions of these locations.
